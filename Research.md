### Benthic invaders shift geochemical regimes by impacting sediments 
![Image](mussels.png|width=100) Recent invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes by dreissenid mussels (zebra mussels and quagga mussels) has caused dramatic changes in the ecology and water chemistry of the lakes. The impacts of mussels on sediments have been hypothesized to play a key role, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We survey the lake floor of upper Great Lakes (Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron) on coverage of invasive mussels, characterize the sediment geochemistry, conduct benthic fluxes experiments to understand the impacts of mussels on biogeochemical transformations and exchanges of elements at the sediment-water interface. Using the results from sediment geochemistry and mussel physiology, we develop a whole-system mass-balance model to investigate the mussels' impact on nutrient dynamics in the water column.
