I study biogeochemistry of aquatic systems focusing on elements C, N, P, S, Fe and Mn. I am interested in understanding how aquatic biogeochemical cycles response to changing environmental conditions. I investigate the dynamics/variability of elemental fluxes and reaction rates, trace sources and transformations of elements, and study the interactions between geochemistry and biological activities. I use multiple approaches including field surveys, chemical analyses, laboratory experiments, stable isotopes, and diagenetic modeling.
