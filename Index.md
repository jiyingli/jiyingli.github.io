# Aquatic Biogeochemistry
We study the physical, biological, and geological -driven exchange and transformation of elements in lakes and oceans, focusing on the cycles of vital elements including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and redox metals. We work on a diverse range of ecosystems including freshwater inland lakes, estuaries, coastal and deep oceans. We couple field and laboratory data with numerical modeling to seek mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical processes across scales in space and time.

## Research Themes 

### - Sediment Geochemistry
Sediment is the ultimate sink of materials from the water column. In sediments, deposits undergo biogeochemical transformations that determine the fate of vital elements. These processes regulate functioning of aquatic ecosystems and impact local and global geochemical cycles. We are interested in quantifying these processes and their impacts, addressing questions including: 1) how does sediment affect and nutrient dynamics and ecology in the water, 2) how does sediment processes contribute to the global geochemical cycling in the long term, 3) and how can we use sediments to quantitatively reconstruct the past and predict the future biogeochemical trajectories.

### - Plankton ecology and nutrient dynamics 
Geochemical cycles affect aquatic ecosystem functions via interacting with biological processes, particularly those of the microorganisms that form the bottom of the food web. We are interested in studying the relationships between nutrient dynamics and plankton physiology and ecology. Our current focus is to understand how primary producers respond to nutrient variability.

### - Aquatic ecosystem responses to climate change and anthropogenic activities
We are interested in how climate affect ecosystems with focus on the geochemical aspect. We incorporate laboratory experiments and analyses to reaction-transport-ecology modeling to understand these impacts.
