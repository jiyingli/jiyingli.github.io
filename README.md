# About Us
We study the physical, biological, chemical and geological -driven exchange and transformation of elements in a diverse range of aquatic ecosystems including lakes, estuaries, coastal and deep oceans. We focus on the cycles of vital elements including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and redox metals, using field and laboratory data coupled with numerical modeling. We seek to understand the mechanistic controls of biogeochemical cycling as well as their climate and environmental implications. 

## Research Themes 

### - Sediment Geochemistry and benthic-pelagic coupling 
Sediments receive materials from the water column. In sediments, materials undergo biogeochemical transformations that determine the fates of vital elements. Some materials/elements recycle back into the water column to support biological activities; some escape the system as gases and enter the atmosphere; some are buried into the deep sediments and leave the biological cycle (enter longer geological cycle). These processes regulate functioning of the aquatic ecosystems and impact local and global biogeochemical cycles. We are interested in quantifying these processes and understanding their controls and impacts. We seek answers to questions such as: 
1) how do sediments affect the chemistry and ecology of the water, 
2) how do sediment processes contribute to regional and global geochemical cycles in the long term, 
3) and how can we use sediments to quantitatively reconstruct the past and predict the future biogeochemical conditions and trends.

### - microbial and geochemical interactions 

Life conveys energy and elements and shapes the chemistry of aquatic systems; biological activities, at the same time, are controled by geochemistry, the availability of life-supporting elements. We are interested in these interactions. Our present research topics include 1) nutrient storage mechanisms in phytoplankton, and 2) phosphorus speciation controled by microbial activities.
