# The Aquatic Geochemistry Lab
We study geochemistry of lakes and oceans, focusing on the cycling of vital elements for life including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and redox metals. We couple field and laboratory data with numerical modeling to study the flow of elements and energy on ecosystem to globle scales and understand how they respond to climate change and human perturbations. 

## Research Themes 

### Biogeochemistry of lakes and oceans
### Sediment Geochemistry
### Plankton ecology
### Climate change and ecosystem response
