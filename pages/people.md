B.S. in Environmental Science, Xiamen University (2021)\
<br/>
PhD student (2023 - now)\
Marine environmental science, HKUST\
Email: yuxuan.lin@connect.ust.hk\
<br/>
Yuxuan studies sediment biogeochemistry, focusing on the coupled cycles of carbon, phosphorus, iron, and sulfur. His study sites include sediments from coastal to pelagic ecosystems (mangroves, seagrass beds, lagoons, and coastal and deep seas).\

**Xiaotian Zhou （周筱田）**  <img align="right" style="float: left; padding-right: 30px;" src="/images/xiaotian2.png" width="180"> \
MPhil in Fishery Resources, Zhejiang Ocean University (2022)\
<br/>
PhD student (2023- now)\
Email: xzhoucl@connect.ust.hk\
<br/>
Xiaotian works on microbial survial strategies under phosphorus limiation and feedback to ecosystem biogeochemical cycles. Her current projects include 1) aerobic methane production from methylated compounds in aquatic environments and 2) roles and dynamics of polyphosphate in cyanobacteria during overwintering.

**Xingyu Yang （楊興宇）**  <img align="right" style="float: left; padding-right: 30px;" src="/images/xingyu.png" width="180"> \
MPhil in Life Science, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2020)\
<br/>
PhD student (2021 - now)\
Marine Environmental Science, HKUST\
Email: xyangbb@connect.ust.hk\
<br/>
Xingyu works on the cryptic cycles of polyphosphate (polyP) in aquatic ecosystems, including plankton polyP metabolisms and the roles of polyP on ecosystem-scale P cycling. His approaches include culture experiments and field studies of diverse systems including coastal and pelagic waters around Hong Kong, as well as the oligotrophic North American Great Lakes.
