### Postgraduate Students

We have two **PhD positions** open for Fall 2023. 

The students will join the Postgraduate Program at the Department of Ocean Science at HKUST, with financial support via Student Scholarships. You will receive multidisciplinary trainings in physical, chemical and biological aspects of marine (aquatic) science and use diverse research approaches including field measurements, laboratory experiments and analyses, and numerical modeling. 

We encourage applicants with strong chemistry (or geochemistry, environmental chemistry and other relevant) background to apply. Prior training in geoscience is NOT required, but you should have strong interests in mulitidisciplinary research. Solid understanding in physics and good mathematical skills (college level) are strongly desired. 

Applicants are encouraged to [get in touch](mailto:jiyingli@ust.hk) early to discuss about your interests and the application. To apply, please go to the HKUST [application system](https://pg.ust.hk/prospective-students/admissions/online-application).
